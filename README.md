 A linked list is a data structure that can store an indefinite amount of items. These items are connected using pointers in a sequential manner.
There are two types of linked list; singly-linked list, and doubly-linked list. In a singly-linked list, every element contains some data and a link to the next element. On the other hand, every node in a doubly-linked list contains some data, a link to the next node and a link to the previous node.
The elements of a linked list are called the nodes. A node has two fields i.e. data and next. 

The data field contains the data being stored in that specific node. It cannot just be a single variable.
There may be many variables presenting the data section of a node. The next field contains the address of the next node. So this is the place where the link between nodes is established.
